# Fullstack MERN E-Commerce Platform

This is a full-stack e-commerce application I built using the MERN stack. It includes all the essential features for a modern online store, with secure authentication, product management, a shopping cart, checkout with PayPal, and an admin dashboard. 

I wanted to create a project that looks and feels like a real-world app â€” both from a technical and user experience point of view.
